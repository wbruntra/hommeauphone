# Homophone Finder

A command-line tool to find homophones (words that sound the same) using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
node homophones.js
```

This starts an interactive session where you can:
- Type any word to find its homophones
- Type "quit" or "exit" to close the program
- Press Ctrl+C to exit

### Test Mode
```bash
node test_homophones.js
```

Runs a demonstration with common words to show how the homophone finder works.

## Features

- **Case insensitive**: Enter words in any case
- **Grouped results**: Shows homophones organized by base word and variants
